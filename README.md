# Procedural Challenges
Hi there! Welcome to my repository for all good procedural challenges from [the subreddit of /r/proceduralgeneration](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration).

I'm very interesting into computer graphics and every topics around video games and simulation. So procedural generation is one of my favorite topics. Redditers from /r/proceduralgeneration proposed each month a challenge for a procedural generated demo. The subject is generally pretty broad and there is a large diversity of works. This is a good opportunity for me to learn more (not only in procedural generation but even in programming) and master procedural generation and computer graphic programming.

Take a tour. This repository contains one folder by challenge.

* April 2017: [Town/City](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/695oxj/monthly_challenge_17_april_2017_procedural/) (My first challenge has [its own repository](https://github.com/Spiralwise/CloverCities).)
* May 2017: [Underwater](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/69nr2u/monthly_challenge_18_may_2017_procedural/)

_This README will be updated at least once by month._
